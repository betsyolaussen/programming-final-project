	<h3>FAQ's</h3>

		<h4>Why are da Bomb Bath Fizzers better than other bath bombs?</h4>

			<p>Why are da Bomb Bath Fizzers better than other bath bombs?</p>
				<ul>
					<li>They smell wonderful.</li>
					<li>Every one has a surprise inside!</li>
					<li>They're made by hand in the USA.</li>
					<li>They're fun to use, since the baking soda and citric acid set off an impressively strong fizzing reaction when you put them in the water.</li>
					<li>They contain moisturizing oils.</li>
					<li>Many of our competitor's bombs are overloaded with up to 22 ingredients and thick, greasy additives. We take a more simple, balanced approach to our bath bombs. They won’t fill your bath with gunk, and our pigment colors won't stain your skin. Instead, they produce what we like to call a "clean fizz."</li>
				</ul>

		<h4>What’s the shelf life of da Bomb bath fizzers?</h4>

			<p>Our fizzers will stay good for a year or more if kept in a cool, dry place in their original packaging. They are always made fresh, and our fragrances are strongest at the time of production. These fragrances may slowly begin to dissipate after about 6 months. If you want to enjoy the full effect of our wonderful fragrances, we recommend using them within a few months of purchase.</p>

		<h4>My bath bombs arrived, and they each look slightly different. Why?</h4>

			<p>Each of our products is handmade. Therefore, they will each have slight differences in appearance. It’s all part of the creation process and helps set our bath bombs apart!</p>
